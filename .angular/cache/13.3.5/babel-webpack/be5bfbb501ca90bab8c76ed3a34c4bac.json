This makes sense because C++ will likely remain\n// faster than JS when doing raw CPU-intensive sorting. However, when using a\n// custom comparator function, calling back and forth between the VM's C++ and\n// JIT'd JS is rather slow *and* loses JIT type information, resulting in\n// worse generated code for the comparator function than would be optimal. In\n// fact, when sorting with a comparator, these costs outweigh the benefits of\n// sorting in C++. By using our own JS-implemented Quick Sort (below), we get\n// a ~3500ms mean speed-up in `bench/bench.html`.\n\n/**\n * Swap the elements indexed by `x` and `y` in the array `ary`.\n *\n * @param {Array} ary\n *        The array.\n * @param {Number} x\n *        The index of the first item.\n * @param {Number} y\n *        The index of the second item.\n */\nfunction swap(ary, x, y) {\n  var temp = ary[x];\n  ary[x] = ary[y];\n  ary[y] = temp;\n}\n/**\n * Returns a random integer within the range `low .. high` inclusive.\n *\n * @param {Number} low\n *        The lower bound on the range.\n * @param {Number} high\n *        The upper bound on the range.\n */\n\n\nfunction randomIntInRange(low, high) {\n  return Math.round(low + Math.random() * (high - low));\n}\n/**\n * The Quick Sort algorithm.\n *\n * @param {Array} ary\n *        An array to sort.\n * @param {function} comparator\n *        Function to use to compare two items.\n * @param {Number} p\n *        Start index of the array\n * @param {Number} r\n *        End index of the array\n */\n\n\nfunction doQuickSort(ary, comparator, p, r) {\n  // If our lower bound is less than our upper bound, we (1) partition the\n  // array into two pieces and (2) recurse on each half.
